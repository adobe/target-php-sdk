 * @description Field is mandatory when Mobile Platform is specified. Only activities that match the specified deviceType or have the device type set to &#39;null&#39; will be evaluated. Ex if device type is &#39;phone&#39; in the delivery request, then only activities that have the device type equal to &#39;phone&#39; or set to &#39;null&#39; will be evaluated. An activity with &#39;null&#39; device type will be evaluated for requests for both, &#39;phone&#39; and &#39;tablet&#39;.
