# Adobe Target PHP SDK

## Quick Start

```bash
$ brew install composer              # Install composer
$ composer install                   # Install dependencies
```

### Create autoload helper
To be able to run the tests we have to ensure that we have a generated auto-loader. To generate the auto-loader use:
```bash
$ composer dump-autoload
``` 
### Run tests
```bash
$ composer test
```

### Format code
```bash
$ composer format
```

### Code generation
The SDK depends on [Target Open API](https://github.com/adobe/target-openapi). It uses Open API and the `Open API generator` to generate the low level HTTP client.

To be able to use `Target Open API` for code generation, we are leveraging Git subtree.

To import `Target Open API` as `openapi` folder please use commands:
```bash
$ git subtree add --prefix openapi git@github.com:adobe/target-openapi.git main --squash
```
To refresh the imported subtree use this command:
```bash
$ git subtree pull --prefix openapi git@github.com:adobe/target-openapi.git main --squash
```

`Open API generator` is a Java application hence the code generation process requires a few tools besides `Composer`:
- Java 8+
- NPM 6+

NPM is required since we are relying on `openapi-generator-cli`.

Once all the tools are installed, there is no need to invoke them directly, everything is wrapped in a `Composer` script, which can be invoked by running:
```bash
$ composer codegen
```
